* Created by [Maksim Rudnev](http://maksimrudnev.com), using Zsofia Ignacz's [idea](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conference/programme2017?sess=19#357).
* Behind all multiple groups factor models stands [```lavaan```](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package.
* Plots are built using multidimensional scaling algorithm in ```cmdscale```. Inputs are Eucledean distances for covariances, correlations, and parameters, and raw increments in fit indices for the increment options.
* Clustering is ```kmeans```, it is added for convienience only in order to get more dimensions to the two dimensional plot.
* The graphical part is based on [ShinyApps.io](http://ShinyApps.io)
